# hangman

hangman is a console-based **game** wherein a player has to **guess** letters from a **mystery word**. 

Every turn a player can provide a letter from the alphabet. 
If that letter makes part of the mystery word, he gets to see the 
places of that letter in the mystery word. The letters that are not 
guessed yet, are left blank. 

A player has **five lives**. If he makes five mistakes, the game is lost.
If a player guesses all of the letters before the lives are up, he **wins**.



### start a game 

Run main.py 



### play the game

Every round, a player is asked to provide one and only one letter from the alphabet (a-z, A-Z). 
If the input is incorrect, the player will be asked to try again until a correct input letter is provided. 



### to do 

Up to now, the game is console-based. One of the next things that could be done is to extend it was a graphical layer.
